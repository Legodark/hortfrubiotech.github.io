Ramon y Cajal fellowships are a sub part of the Spanish National Plan for [Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation](http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.7eeac5cd345b4f34f09dfd1001432ea0/?vgnextoid=83b192b9036c2210VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD) and are aimed to incorporate national and foreign researchers with an outstanding track record. The fellowships are of a competitive nature, with a five year duration and provide co funding for the hiring of researchers followed by the creation of permanent positions at those institutions of the Spanish System for Science, Technology and Innovation which are beneficiaries of the funds like the [University of M치laga](http://www.uma.es).

In addition to the initial assessment that gives access to the position, the performance of the researchers is reevaluated by the National Evaluation Agency ([ANEP](http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.26172fcf4eb029fa6ec7da6901432ea0/?vgnextoid=3d5167b99490f310VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD)) during the second and fourth years of the contract.  

Also during the fourth year and on a voluntary basis, researchers can undergo further evaluation to obtain the I3 Certification on the framework of the Incentivation Programme for the Incorporation and Intensification of Research Activity ([I3 Programme](http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.dbc68b34d11ccbd5d52ffeb801432ea0/?vgnextoid=28b5b76fb9bbf210VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD)) which entitles the institutions retaining I3 researchers to further funding.
